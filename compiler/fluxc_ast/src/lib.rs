//! Defines AST data structures and types for representing Flux code at compile
//! time.
//!
//! The AST is split into two primary modules:
//! - `fluxc_ast::expr`: Contains the expression AST data structures, or things
//!   that have types.
//! - `fluxc_ast::stmt`: Contains the statement AST data structures.
//!
//! The AST is built from the parser, iterated over by reducers in the
//! `fluxc_ast_passes` crate, before being sent to `fluxc_codegen` and turned
//! into valid LLVM code.
