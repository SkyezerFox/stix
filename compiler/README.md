# Compiler

The Styx compiler is responsible for translating Styx source code into

## Usage

> Note: This is the usage specification for the compiler CLI, which does not currently exist! The Styx CLI is also referenced, which also does not currently exist!

### Run a Styx script

```sh
$ styxc hello-world.stx
# or, use the styx CLI
$ styx hello-world.stx
hello world!
```

### Compile a Styx script

```sh
$ styxc --binary hello-world.stx -o hello-world
# or, use the styx CLI
$ styx compile hello-world.stx -o hello-world
$ ./hello-world
hello world!
```

## Stages

1. Lexing - The compiler takes an input source file and generates a stream of identifiable tokens.
2. Parsing - The compiler takes tokens generated by the previous step and produces an AST.
3. Semantic analysis - The compiler descends through the AST ensuring variables are correctly typed, referenced, and declared.
4. IR generation - The compiler produces LLVM IR from the AST.
5. Code generation - The compiler produces platform and architecture specific machine code.

## Crates

-   [`styxc`](./styxc) - The compiler entrypoint and CLI interface.
-   [`styxc_ast`](./styxc_ast) - Contains type definitions and handles the semantic analysis of the AST.
-   [`styxc_ir`](./styxc_ir) - Handles the generation of LLVM IR using the Cranelift IR generator from the AST.
-   [`styxc_lexer`](./styxc_lexer) - Generates a `TokenStream` from an input string.
-   [`styxc_parser`](./styxc_parser) - Parses a `TokenStream` into an AST.

## Modes

The Styx compiler has two distinct modes.

-   JIT - The compiler immediately triggers execution of compiles source code as soon as it is finished. Dynamic imports are enabled, and will be compiled as soon as they are imported.
-   AOT - The compiler builds a static binary for the target system and architecture which can be run at a later date.
